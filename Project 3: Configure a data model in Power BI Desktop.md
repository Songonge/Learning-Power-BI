## Introduction
This project is the continuation of the one on [**Load Data in Power BI Desktop**](https://github.com/Songonge/Learning-Power-BI/blob/main/Project%202%3A%20Load%20Data%20in%20Power%20BI%20Desktop.md). It involves 
creating relationships between tables, and then configuring table and column properties to improve the friendliness and usability of the data model. In this project, I create hierarchies and quick measures.

## Project Objectives
*	Create model relationships
*	Configure table and column properties
*	Create hierarchies
