# Project #1: Get Data in Power BI Desktop

# Introduction
This project is an introduction to the Power BI Desktop application. It explains how to connect to data and how to use data preview techniques to understand the characteristics and quality of the source data. 

## Project Objectives
* Open Power BI Desktop
* Connect to different data sources
* Preview source data  with Power Query
* Use data profiling features in Power Query

## Steps Completed Throughout the Project
To begin with, I downloaded the zip folder through the [link](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/PL-300-Microsoft-Power-BI-Data-Analyst/raw/Main/Allfiles/Labs/01-prepare-data-with-power-query-in-power-bi-desktop/01-prepare-data.zip) provided. Then, after I extracted 
everything, I opened the .pbix file. The following settings have been disabled:  
* Data Load > Import relationships from data sources on first load
* Data Load > Autodetect new relationships after data is loaded  
This was done to avoid that Power BI automatically creates relationshipds between the data (tables).

### Getting Data From SQL Server
To complete this step, I installed SQL Server on my computer. Then, using the backup file (.bak file), I was able to extract the tables and load them in the SQL Server. The steps are given below.
